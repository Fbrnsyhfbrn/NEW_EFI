New Year's celebration, I can finally release EFI in Haswell, which is smoother than before and compatible with Sonoma 14.
This is a Hackintosh project that may be the end of this project's release, because I am now a designer and no longer a modder like last year. 
I have also finally managed to get the camera feature working properly in this EFI version. 
This EFI uses an automatic build, not one I created entirely myself, 
but I did make some changes for compatibility with my ThinkPad T440p. 
Maybe someday I will create a version for other laptops.
